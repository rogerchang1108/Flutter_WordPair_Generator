# Flutter_WordPair_Generator

This project is organizally from [codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0), which builds a application generating cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes.
